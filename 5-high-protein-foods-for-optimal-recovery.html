Your workout isn't really over until you address the three Rs of recovery: Rehydrate, Refuel and Rebuild.</p><section class="section articles-featured-events activities-block"></section><p>Drinking fluids to replace what you lost during your workout in sweat (rehydrating) is as essential as eating carbs to replace muscle glycogen stores that you torched (refueling).</p><p>But while many athletes guzzle sports drinks to recover, or eat a carbohydrate-rich snack, they often forget about the protein necessary to rebuild broken down muscle fibers. Without adequate protein, your muscles will take longer to recover, and some studies suggest you'll be more likely to suffer from burnout and symptoms of overtraining.</p><p>While strength athletes generally consume enough protein, endurance athletes, ball players and many others forget that protein is as important as carbs and fluids for recovery.</p><h2><strong> How Much Protein is Enough?</strong></h2><p> </p><p>A good rule of thumb for protein requirements: consume 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass. In addition, experts recommend 15 to 25 grams of high-quality protein within the first few hours after working out.</p><p>To help, here are five top protein-rich foods for optimal recovery. These foods focus on the type of high-quality protein that has been linked to strength gains.</p><p><strong>Nonfat or Lowfat Greek Yogurt (8 oz): 22 to 24 grams protein.</strong> Greek yogurt is a must-have in most athletes' diets because it provides more protein per calorie than most other foods.</p><div id="inarticle1" class="js-ad-placeholder show" data-position="inarticle1" data-ad-size="[[300, 250], &quot;fluid&quot;, [1, 1]]"></div><p>In addition, it provides a combination of casein and whey protein, and because most of the lactose in yogurt is removed, it's still a viable option for most people who are lactose intolerant.</p><p>Flavored varieties of Greek yogurt contain more carbs per serving (from added sugars), so stick with plain or vanilla, and add berries or other fruit to get more antioxidant-rich, lower-calorie carbohydrate sources.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Low-fat Chocolate Milk (8 oz): 8 grams protein.</strong> Low-fat chocolate milk provides a 3 to 1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein, so it helps to replace glycogen while providing the essential amino acids your muscles need to recover.</p><p>Research suggests that chocolate milk works just as well as other sports drinks for enhancing recovery among endurance athletes. Chocolate milk provides a blend of both whey and casein proteins, which may provide advantages versus foods with a single-source of protein.</p><p><strong>Cottage Cheese (8 oz): 28 grams protein.</strong> Non-fat cottage cheese packs in more protein per calorie than virtually any other food, making it a great option for athletes concerned about weight or trying to lean out for a competition.</p><p>Cottage cheese is one of the most naturally-rich sources of the muscle-building amino acid, leucine. For example, a cup of cottage cheese packs in 2.9 grams leucine compared to 1.4 grams in yogurt and .3 grams in an egg. The essential amino acid is considered the "limiting" factor for muscle gains and it's why many protein supplements contain added leucine.</p><p><strong>Eggs (1 medium): 6 grams protein.</strong> As the gold standard for protein, eggs are on the must-eat list of most amateur and professional athletes.</p><p>A medium egg has just over 6 grams of protein of the highest biological value—meaning it's complete with all amino acids in the most digestible form.</p><p>Eggs also contain 13 other vitamins and minerals—virtually everything you need with the exception of vitamin C.</p><p><strong>Pistachios (1 oz/49 pistachios): 6 grams protein</strong>. Pistachios make a nutritious and easy on-the-go-recovery choice. These flavorful green nuts provide antioxidants that may speed recovery, as well as potassium and sodium, two electrolytes lost in sweat.</p><div id="inarticle1" class="js-ad-placeholder show" data-position="inarticle1" data-ad-size="[[300, 250], &quot;fluid&quot;, [1, 1]]"></div><p>A serving of roasted and salted pistachios contains a whopping 310 mg potassium and 160 mg sodium, compared to 35 mg potassium and 95 mg sodium found in popular sports drinks.   </p></article></div></div></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 24, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/authors/jesse-martin/" title="jesse martin">jesse martin</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/12-reasons-black-coffee-drinkers-are-slaying-life.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>12 Reasons Black Coffee Drinkers Are Slaying Life</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/nuts-and-seeds-in-an-athletes-diet.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Nuts and Seeds in an Athlete&#x27;s Diet</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/5-tips-and-steps-for-brewing-best-coffee.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/21/responsive/Brew-at-Home-Trees-Organic-VAN_5151r-1024x842-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="842" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/5-tips-and-steps-for-brewing-best-coffee.html" class="inverse">5 Tips and Steps for Brewing Best Coffee</a></h4><time datetime="2023-05-31T12:50" class="u-small">May 31, 2023</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/best-herbs-and-spices-for-brain-health.html" class="inverse">Best Herbs And Spices For Brain Health</a></h4><time datetime="2023-05-29T16:27" class="u-small">May 29, 2023</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/coffee/">coffee</a> <span class="u-small">(6)</span></li><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/foods/">Foods</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/tea/">tea</a> <span class="u-small">(9)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/">Frozennotes</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
