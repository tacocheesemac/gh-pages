A shot of espresso is particularly well known for this, but what tends to be lesser well known is the fact that espresso offers several other benefits.</p><p>If you needed another reason to drink espresso, we’ve got just the list for you. This list covers the top five health benefits of drinking espresso, from enjoying improved memory functions to helping you shed a few pounds.</p><h2>1. It enhances long-term memory</h2><p>Mastering the art of pouring the perfect espresso shot is worth it when you consider that by drinking the right amount of caffeine, you can improve your long-term memory.</p><p>Neuro-scientist Michael Yassa, from the University of California, conducted a study which found that drinking the equivalent of two espressos enhanced the process of memory consolidation. This process, in turn, improved long-term memory among the subjects.</p><p>Stick to the recommended amount if you want to see improvements since the study did not find any benefits for those who consumed more or less than two cups.</p><h2>2. It increases attention</h2><p>Many people start off their day with a shot of espresso, and this comes as no surprise. Caffeine has been found to reduce symptoms of fatigue, while also improving sustained attention and vigilance. These effects are thought to occur thanks to a neuro-chemical interaction.</p><div class="code-block code-block-1"> </div><p>Coffee maintains a greater dopamine concentration, particularly in the areas of the brain that are linked to attention. Keep in mind that the benefits tend to be short-term, and you want to avoid overdoing it. Too much caffeine can make you feel jittery, making it far harder to concentrate.</p><h2>3. It can help you lose weight</h2><p>What sets espresso apart from some of the other beverages found at coffee shops, is that it is low-calorie. It only contains about three calories per ounce, assuming you’re not adding any sugar or cream.</p><div id="om-hbde46r9eze9dh6bk9nn-holder"></div><p>But, besides being low-calorie, it can also help to improve your exercise performance. A study published in the Medicine and Science in Sports Journal found that caffeine made workouts appear less strenuous, by lowering the perceived level of exertion by over 5%.</p><p>Besides making exercise seem easier, coffee also reduces the level of perceived muscle pain which occurs when doing exercises. Ingesting a dose of caffeine equivalent to two or three cups of coffee an hour before 30 minutes of workout reduces muscle pain, allowing you to push yourself a little bit harder.</p><div id="om-yqqz9xbt3tvb5bcmc51i-holder"></div><h2>4. It reduces the risk of a stroke</h2><p>In a Swedish study conducted by Susanna Larsson, researchers found that drinking at least one cup of coffee a day can lessen the risk of suffering from a stroke. This result is thought to be due to the antioxidant properties of coffee.</p><p>The study concentrated on a group of women over a 10-year period. They concluded that drinking one or more cups of coffee a day reduced your chances of suffering from a stroke by 25%. Another study found similar results in male smokers, whose risk was reduced by 21% with eight or more cups of coffee a day.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2"> </div><h2>5. It lowers your risk of diabetes</h2><p>In a study led by Harvard School of Public Health, researchers found that higher coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The study analyzed caffeine consumption in men and women over a four-year period.</p><p>It concluded that those who increased their daily coffee consumption by more than one cup lowered their risk of type 2 diabetes by 11%. Of course, drinking more coffee is just one factor that can influence diabetes risk, so you still want to be physically active and watch your weight.</p><p>Espressos provide several health benefits, so you don’t have to feel so guilty about your caffeine addiction. Even if you’re not the biggest fan of a regular espresso, there are many different coffee serving styles out there, so you’ll be sure to find something that meets your taste.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 23, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/authors/jesse-martin/" title="jesse martin">jesse martin</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/this-hot-herbal-tea-will-soothe-your-throat-and-calm-your-cough.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>This Hot Herbal Tea Will Soothe Your Throat and Calm Your Cough</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/12-reasons-black-coffee-drinkers-are-slaying-life.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>12 Reasons Black Coffee Drinkers Are Slaying Life</h5></div></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/everyone-suddenly-drinking-aloe-juice.html" class="inverse"> Everyone Suddenly Drinking Aloe Juice?</a></h4><time datetime="2023-05-29T16:30" class="u-small">May 29, 2023</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/best-herbs-and-spices-for-brain-health.html" class="inverse">Best Herbs And Spices For Brain Health</a></h4><time datetime="2023-05-29T16:27" class="u-small">May 29, 2023</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/7-amazing-benefits-of-drinking-green-tea.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/5/responsive/holding-green-fftea-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="468" width="640" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/7-amazing-benefits-of-drinking-green-tea.html" class="inverse">7 Amazing Benefits of Drinking Green Tea</a></h4><time datetime="2023-05-19T12:31" class="u-small">May 19, 2023</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/coffee/">coffee</a> <span class="u-small">(6)</span></li><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/foods/">Foods</a> <span class="u-small">(2)</span></li><li><a href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/tags/tea/">tea</a> <span class="u-small">(9)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://tacocheesemac.github.io/gh-pages/">Frozennotes</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
